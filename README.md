# 🚀 3D Model Viewer – Interactive Web-Based 3D Exploration Tool

🌐 **Live Demo:** https://3d-viewer-eight.vercel.app  
📂 **Repository:** https://github.com/Omkarkumbhar47/3D-Viewer  
👨‍💻 **Author:** Omkar Kumbhar

---

## 📌 Overview

A powerful **browser-based 3D Model Viewer** built using **React, Three.js, and React Three Fiber** that allows users to load, explore, and interact with 3D models in real time.

This application focuses on performance, usability, and intuitive model interaction, making it suitable for engineering previews, product visualization, and design inspection workflows.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional 3D model inspection tools often require heavy desktop software and complex installations.
This project solves that by providing a **lightweight, responsive, and interactive web-based 3D viewer** that runs directly in the browser.
